If array is in ascending order, it is in min heap.
If array is in descending order, it is in max heap.

Below table shows indexes of other nodes for the ith node, i.e., Arr[i]:
Arr[(i-1)/2]	Returns the parent node
Arr[(2*i)+1]	Returns the left child node
Arr[(2*i)+2]	Returns the right child node

The traversal method use to achieve Array representation is Level Order
