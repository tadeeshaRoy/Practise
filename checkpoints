**ALWAYS CHECK WITH LARGE INPUTS!!
also cases like in 'many chef' CHEFA is lexicographically greater than ACHEF.. these small test cases are real game changers

1. Can’t access a vector if memory is not initialized like:

vector<int> n;
n[2]=1 // can’t do this

vector<int> n (m);
n[2]=1 // can do this 


2. && is logical and & is bitwise:

if(a>0 && b>0) 

if(4&5)

3. u should use (r-l)/2 +l
and l+r/2
both give diff answer in case of even num,ber
so u should be careful;l what to use when

4. again one thing u should take care if u use vector:
if u are doing :
vector<int> v; than u can not use v[i]="value" to assign a value u will get segmentation fault
vector<int > v(n): what this do is create a vector of size n with all its value assign to 0.: let say n=5 than our vector value is 0 0 0 0 0 u can assign v[i]='value' in this case one more things if u do : vector<int> v(n); v.push_back(lets say value from 1 to 5) than your vector will become 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 so you will have 10 element.
to avoid this 10 element situation first u need to clear the vector: v.clear() after that if u do push_back, tahn u will have only 5 el;ement 1 2 3 4 5

5. check overflow

if(rev > (INT_MAX/10) || rev==(INT_MAX/10) && digit>(INT_MAX%10))
            return 0;

6. modulo takes sign of first operand: https://www.quora.com/C-Programming-How-does-the-modulus-operator-work-when-we-divide-a-smaller-number-by-a-larger-number-For-example-3-5-or-5-10

7. ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); Sets whether the standard C++ streams are synchronized to the standard C streams after each input/output operation.

8. when it involves precision: cout << fixed << setprecision(6) << res; (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14432043/float-formatting-in-c)
